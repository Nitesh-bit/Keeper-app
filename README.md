### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

This is a Keeper app which is a demo app for Google Notes app.
In this I have used React.js tech for the front-end part
And also I have applied material-ui for the UI elements.
